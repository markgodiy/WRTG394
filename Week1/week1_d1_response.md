In the world of IT, there's a tricky balancing act between keeping data safe and making sure everyone can still do their job without too much friction and obstacles. Imagine a team trying to lock everything up tight to protect against hackers and leaks. They might set up tough rules about who can get into certain computer systems, make people change their passwords frequenty, or use special techniques to keep data safe. While this is great for security, it can make life difficult for everyone else. People who need to get their work done might find themselves locked out, forgetting their new passwords, or dealing with slow computers because of all the security checks. This can lead to a lot of frustration and confusion, and it can even make people less safe if they start trying to find ways around the security measures -- which is a very common problem.  

### 1. What is the specific problem with communication?

Sometimes, the changes are implemented with little or no explanation, leaving end users feeling confused and frustrated. This can lead to a lack of compliance with security measures, as end users may not understand the importance of the changes or may feel that they are unnecessary obstacles to their work.

If the IT team doesn't communicate the reasons for the changes and the potential risks of not following them, end users may not understand the importance of the security measures. This can lead to a lack of compliance and potentially put sensitive data at risk.

It is widely recognized that the weakest link of the cybersecurity chain is the human factor. If end users are not aware of the importance of security measures or do not understand how to follow them, they may inadvertently compromise the security of the organization's data.

### 2. Does the problem represent an example of one of the barriers that the articles by Dr. Rani and Lumen Learning identify? If so, which one(s)?

Yes, this problem aligns with several barriers identified in both articles:

Language Barriers: The technical jargon and complex explanations used by IT professionals can alienate or confuse non-technical staff and end users​​​​.  

Environmental Barriers: The 'environment' in this context isn't physical but relates to the operational and cultural setting of an organization.  

Information overload: The complexity of IT security measures can overwhelm non-technical staff, leading to confusion and frustration​​​​.

Lack of Source Familiarity or Credibility: End-users will likely not understand nor even care about the necessity of security measures if they are not communicated effectively​​​​.

### 3. What are some possible communication strategies in notifying someone about the problem?

If I need to communicate this problem with my IT leadership, I might use the following strategies:

Understand my audience so I can use clear language with the appropriate type and level of technical details to communicate the problem and the potential risks of non-compliance with security measures.

Provide specific examples of how the lack of communication has led to confusion and frustration among end users.

Highlight the potential risks of non-compliance with security measures and the importance of clear communication in ensuring the effectiveness of security measures.

Propose a plan for improving communication between IT and non-technical staff, such as regular updates, interactive Q&A sessions, and clear guidelines on whom to contact for help with IT-related issues.

### 4. What is the best course of action for you to take in solving the problem?

A few possible courses of action include:

Develop a communication plan that includes regular updates in straightforward language, interactive Q&A sessions, and clear guidelines on whom to contact for help with IT-related issues.

Work closely with a representative group of end users to test and refine the communication for clarity and effectiveness before wider distribution.

Implement a training program that educates non-technical staff on basic IT security principles and best practices in a non-intimidating way.

### 5. What is the best way for you to communicate this problem to the relevant individuals?

Written Reports: Draft a report that highlights the communication gap, supported by specific examples and the potential negative outcomes. Emphasize the importance of clear communication for the effectiveness of security measures.

Presentations: Prepare a presentation for key stakeholders that outlines the identified problems, proposed communication strategies, and the benefits of improving communication between IT and non-technical staff.

Personal Discussions: Engage in one-on-one or small group discussions with stakeholders to gather input and build support for the proposed communication improvements.

Internal website or newsletter: Create a dedicated section on the company's internal website or newsletter to share updates, tips, and resources related to IT security and communication.
