#  Week 2 Discussion 2

This discussion will enable you to plan for the first writing assignment. For this discussion, you will propose some problem you wish to solve, either in the workplace or your community, a target audience—specifically the decision-maker that you will eventually write to—and some primary research you would like to do. Be sure to read the complete directions for more details. Provide feedback for at least one classmate's answers.

NOTE: This is not your first writing assignment.  This is a discussion topic that is designed to help prepare you for the third writing assignment.

To complete your assignment, you will access the Assignments area and review the assignment directions.  Then you will complete and submit your draft of the assignment in your assignment folder.

Your first assignment in WRTG 394 involves writing a memo requesting permission to conduct research on the topic for your research report.  You should focus on the following as you prepare your memo:

Be specific - your assignment directions (located in the assignment area of the classroom) give you good examples of ways in which you can make sure that you are proposing a solution to a specific problem. You must answer the question, "How will MY workplace or community (this should be narrowly defined as your neighborhood, apartment community, base housing community, etc.) be made better by the solution(s) I recommend?"

Identify a specific decision maker (or makers if, for example, you are proposing a solution to a workplace issue in your department that might require action by the HR director as well as your dept. head). Examples of such persons might be your apartment community manager, the director of base housing where you are stationed, your department head in your workplace, or your commander for your military unit.

Offer some examples of the kind of secondary research you will do on this topic. (This should be research that includes both scholarly and professional/trade sources.) 

Complete the following task. Post your completed task as your response to this discussion topic. 

For this discussion topic, please respond with a paragraph in which you describe the topic you are proposing, the audience (the decision maker(s) mentioned above), and some additional secondary research you may wish to do. 

## Response Draft 1

(business writing uses first-person view, active voice, and concise, direct language. )

I am proposing to conduct research on the problem of workplace communication at my company. I will write a memo to the company's CEO, who is the decision maker. I will also conduct secondary research on the topic of workplace communication. I will look for scholarly and professional/trade sources that discuss the most effective communication techniques for businesses. I will also look for sources that discuss the most common communication problems in businesses and how to solve them.

## Response Draft 2

Research topic: How to increase engagement of PowerShell automation in my workplace to improve efficiency and reduce human error. PowerShell scripting is intimidating to many IT professionals, and I want to research how to make it more accessible, exciting, and user-friendly.

DecisionMaker: My department head, who is responsible for approving training and new technology implementation in our department.

Benefit to my workplace: PowerShell automation can help us automate repetitive tasks, reduce human error, and improve efficiency in our department. Compared to using GUI tools, PowerShell automation grants us more control and access to more features and functionalities. It can also help us save time and resources by automating tasks that would otherwise require manual intervention.
It's also a valuable skill to have in the IT industry, and learning it can help us improve our career prospects. 

Secondary research: I will look for scholarly and professional/trade sources that discuss the benefits of scripting automation in the workplace. I will also look for sources that discuss the most common challenges in implementing PowerShell automation and how to overcome them.


## Draft Memo 

To: [Decision Maker]

Date: [Today's Date]
Subject: Request for Permission to Conduct Research on Improving Engagement and Knowledge of PowerShell Automation in the IT Department

Summary of the Problem:

The IT department at [Your Company] is not using PowerShell automation to its full potential. PowerShell scripting is intimidating to many IT professionals, and the lack of knowledge and engagement in PowerShell automation is causing inefficiency and human error in our department. PowerShell automation can help us automate repetitive tasks, reduce human error, and improve efficiency in our department. Compared to using GUI tools, PowerShell automation grants us more control and access to more features and functionalities. It can also help us save time and resources by automating tasks that would otherwise require manual intervention. It's also a valuable skill to have in the IT industry, and learning it can help us improve our career prospects.

Proposed Solution:

I would like to conduct research on how to increase engagement of PowerShell automation in our workplace to improve efficiency and reduce human error. I believe that by making PowerShell scripting more accessible, exciting, and user-friendly, we can encourage more IT professionals to learn and use PowerShell automation in our department. This research will help us identify the most effective communication techniques for businesses and the most common communication problems in businesses and how to solve them.

Research Plan:

I will conduct secondary research on the topic of workplace communication. I will look for scholarly and professional/trade sources that discuss the benefits of scripting automation in the workplace. I will also look for sources that discuss the most common challenges in implementing PowerShell automation and how to overcome them. I will use this research to develop a proposal for improving engagement and knowledge of PowerShell automation in the IT department.

I am requesting permission to conduct this research and would appreciate your support in this endeavor. I believe that this research will benefit our department and help us improve our efficiency and productivity.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
