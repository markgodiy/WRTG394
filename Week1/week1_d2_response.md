This discussion topic is designed to give you the opportunity to peruse the assignment instructions for all the research related writing assignments in WRTG 394. 

This task will allow you to begin thinking about and planning for your WRTG 394 research writing assignments, the Synthesis Literature Review, the Research Proposal Memo, and the Research-Based Report. 

NOTE: This is a discussion topic designed to help you begin thinking about the three research-related writing assignments in WRTG 394. Completing this discussion topic does not complete any of the assignments discussed in this topic. This simply helps you become familiar with your assignments so that you can plan for the rest of your WRTG 394 course.

In the Assignments area of the 394 classroom, open each of the following sets of writing assignment instructions that are located in your individual assignment folders for each assignment:

Assignment: research proposal memo
Assignment: synthesis literature review
Assignment: research-based report
Please use these assignment instructions to help you answer the following questions:

1. Examine the Research Proposal Memo (Writing Assignment #1) instructions. 

What permission must you request?  Permission to research and write about a specific topic.

To whom should your memo be addressed? One or more individuals who are in a position to grant you permission to research and write about the topic.

What information about your research must you provide? The memo must discuss the topic I plan to research and write about in Writing Assignment writing assignment #2 and writing assignment #3. It should also include a brief explanation of why the topic is important, what benefits the research will provide, and how I plan to conduct the research.

2. Examine the Synthesis Lit Review (WA#2) instructions.
This assignment calls for the student writer to use scholarly (academic) and professional (trade) sources. Explain what you understand a scholarly source and a professional/trade source to be.  

A scholarly source is a publication that is written by experts in a particular field and is intended for an audience of other experts in that field. It is usually peer-reviewed, meaning that other experts in the field have reviewed the work before it is published. A professional/trade source is a publication that is written by professionals in a particular field and is intended for an audience of other professionals in that field. It is not peer-reviewed, but it is still considered a reliable source of information.

An example of a scholarly source is a journal like the The Journal of Information Technology (JIT)(https://journals.sagepub.com/home/jin), while an example of a professional/trade source is a publication like SysAdmin magazine (https://www.netwrix.com/sysadmin_magazine.html).

3. Take a look at the Research Report (WA#3) instructions.  
What additional research demands are placed upon the writer for this assignment compared to WA #2?  
How can you as writer best present your report so that it is most readily accessible for your primary audience?

Writing assignment #3, Research-based Report, requires the writer to conduct original research, which means that the writer must collect and analyze data to answer a research question. The writer must also present the findings of the research in a clear and organized manner. To make the report most readily accessible for the primary audience, the writer should use clear and straightforward language, organize the report logically, and use visual aids like charts and graphs to present data.

4. Writing on the same topic for WA#2 and WA#3 make the writing of the research report an easier task than it would have been if different topics had been chosen.  Comment on how the writing on the same topic for both these assignments can help you as you write your research report.  
<br>Sticking to the same topic for both the Lit Review and the Research Report is actually a huge advantage for me. It means I can build on the research and insights I've already gathered, deepening my understanding and refining my arguments along the way. This continuity not only saves me time but also enriches the quality of my work. By the time I start drafting the Research Report, I'm not starting from scratch but expanding on a solid foundation of knowledge. It feels like having a head start, giving me the momentum to tackle the issue's complexities with confidence.
