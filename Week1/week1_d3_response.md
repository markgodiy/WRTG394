The transition from using passive to active voice in business writing, as compared to academic writing, is a significant change that I find both interesting, surprising and potentially challenging. In academic writing, the passive voice is  used to create an objective tone, which can sometimes result in a disconnect between the action and the actor. However, business writing demands an active voice to provide clear and direct communication, which is essential for decisiveness and efficiency. Remembering to consistently use the active voice can be a challenge, especially for those of us accustomed to the more detached style of academic writing, but it's crucial for effective business communication.



The Lumen Learning resource discusses how email and other web based forms of communication and reduced memo use in workplaces. Consider your own workplace (or a similar setting such as an organization/club/team, etc.) you belong to or are involved with and discuss whether your own experience in the communication setting you have chosen seems to prove that Lumen's claim about the "death of memos" seems valid or seems - premature, let's say.
