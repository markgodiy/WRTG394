The transition from using passive to active voice in business writing, as compared to academic writing, is a significant change that I find both interesting, surprising and potentially challenging. In academic writing, the passive voice is  used to create an objective tone, which can sometimes result in a disconnect between the action and the actor. However, business writing demands an active voice to provide clear and direct communication, which is essential for decisiveness and efficiency. Remembering to consistently use the active voice can be a challenge, especially for those of us accustomed to the more detached style of academic writing, but it's crucial for effective business communication.
