# Writing Assignment #2: Synthesis Literature Review

## Assignment Summary

For Writing Assignment #2 in WRTG 394, you are tasked with gathering research sources for the topic you selected in Writing Assignment #1 (Proposal Memo). Using these sources, you will compose a Literature Review that synthesizes the information from your sources regarding your chosen topic. Your Synthesis Literature Review should:

- Be at least 1000 words in length.
- Utilize at least seven (7) sources.

## Relationship to Other Assignments

The Synthesis Literature Review serves as the intermediate step in the WRTG 394 assignment sequence, bridging the Proposal Memo (WA #1) and the Research Report (WA #4). In WA #1, you identified a problem within your workplace or community and proposed potential solutions. The Synthesis Literature Review will have you examine your sources' perspectives on your topic, showcasing agreements, disagreements, and divergent views through synthesis. This process will deepen your understanding of the topic and assist in formulating a problem statement and proposing solutions for the Research Report (WA #3).

## Requirements for the Synthesis Literature Review

1. **Clear Thesis**: Present a thesis statement that outlines the themes identified in your sources.
2. **Structured Headings**: Use headings for each section. A template is provided below for guidance.
3. **Thematic Analysis**: For each identified theme, discuss the consensus and variances among your sources.
4. **Style and Length**: Ensure the review meets the word count requirement and follows proper business writing style.
5. **APA 7th Edition**: Use APA citation style for in-text citations and the reference page.

## Structuring Your Synthesis Literature Review

Follow the provided template, adjusting the headers as needed. Identify 2-5 themes within your sources, focusing on those found in at least two sources.

### Introduction

Introduce your topic, its significance, and your thesis statement, which should highlight the themes discovered in your sources.

### Theme I

Describe what your sources say about this theme and analyze their agreements, disagreements, and any divergent viewpoints.

### Theme II

Similarly, explore another theme, reporting on your sources' contributions and how they complement or contradict each other.

### Theme III

Continue with additional themes, following the same structure of reporting and analysis.

(Note: You may identify up to five themes for discussion. Typically, three themes are common.)

### Conclusion

Conclude by summarizing the discussed themes and their implications for your topic. Highlight the importance of your research and the necessity of further exploration.
