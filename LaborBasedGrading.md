# Choosing Your Labor-Based Grade for WRTG 394

In WRTG 394, YOU have the autonomy to determine the extent of effort you wish to invest in the course. Make your labor-based grade selection known to your professor via the Assignment area. Remember, you have the flexibility to modify your choice up until Week 8, with a reminder provided in Week 5.

## The BASIC LEVEL

For a “B” grade, undertake the following:

### Standard Assignments (Three Required)

1. Submit a first draft by the due date.
2. Incorporate all revisions, edits, and corrections as advised by your professor. Perfection is not a requirement, but evidence of revision based on feedback is necessary.
3. Resubmit the draft for professorial feedback by the specified deadline. Late or non-submissions will impact your grade as detailed in the assignment rubric.

### Weekly Discussion Topics

1. Provide an initial response to each prompt, adhering to the word count requirement, typically around 50 words.
2. Engage with peers by providing substantive feedback, going beyond mere compliments. Responses should also adhere to a 50-word count. Refer to the Discussions rubric for evaluation criteria.

### Midterm and Final Reflections

1. Submit two brief essays (approximately 150 words each) in Weeks 5 and 8, reflecting on your course experience. These reflections require no revisions but must be completed for grading.
2. Adhere closely to the assignment guidelines as outlined in the rubric.

## Raising Your Grade to an "A"

Should you aim for an “A,” the following additional tasks are available until the end of Week 7, with revision being optional:

1. A PowerPoint presentation on WA #3 (your research report), incorporating audio commentary on the report’s themes (minimum of 10 slides).
2. If unable to produce a PowerPoint with audio, two alternative assignments may be pursued (with professorial consent):
   - An essay on the historical use of templates/boilerplate in professional documents, requiring at least two sources and a minimum of 250 words.
   - An additional business communication-related assignment, such as a short report, memo, or business letter, also at least 250 words in length.

## For C or D Grades

Life’s exigencies, including work and family commitments, may impede your coursework. In such cases:

- **To achieve a “C”**: Complete all assignments, initial discussion posts, and both reflections.
- **For a “D”**: Submit first drafts for all assignments, initial posts for six out of eight discussion weeks, and both reflections.

### Final Note

Your grade preference should be recorded under the “LABOR BASED GRADE CHOICE” assignment. You're free to change your selection up to Week 8. Absence of a grade choice will default to the "B" grade criteria.
