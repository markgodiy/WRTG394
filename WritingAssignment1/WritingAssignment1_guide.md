# Writing Assignment #1: Proposal Memo to Decision-maker

## Assignment Summary
You must write a Proposal Memo at least 800 words long. The memo must discuss the topic you plan to research and write about in Writing Assignment (WA) #2 (a Synthesis Literature Review) and WA #3, the Research Report. Your Proposal Memo topic should focus on two tasks:
- Defining a problem in your workplace or community (neighborhood) persuasively and accurately.
- Proposing a solution or solutions to the problem or issue.

## How Your Proposal Memo (WA #1) Relates to the Synthesis Literature Review (WA #2) and the Research Report (WA #3)
The topic you choose for your proposal memo must be the topic you write about in WA #2 and WA #3. Choose carefully. Do not choose a topic that is too broad, too narrow, or too obscure. See the Instructions for WA #3 for a list of possible topics you might choose from. Almost all of these are topics for which you will be able to find research sources. You may also take one of the WA #3 topics and develop your own topic based upon it or related to it. Again, use caution. It is a very good idea to choose a topic and then do some preliminary research. If you cannot easily find sources for the topic you have chosen, you should choose another topic.

To complete this assignment successfully, your completed Proposal Memo should contain the following:
1. Your memo is structured/formatted with correct sections and headings.
