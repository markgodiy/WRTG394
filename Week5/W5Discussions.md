This short video follows up on the various APA and library video tutorials you have seen this semester. Sometimes a paper actually has a DOI, but the library interface does not show it. The website mentioned in this video, https://www.crossref.org/documentation/reference-linking/how-do-i-create-reference-links/, is an excellent website to use to confirm whether the paper has a DOI or not.
