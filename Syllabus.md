## Course Description
(Fulfills the general education requirement in upper-level advanced writing). Prerequisite: WRTG 112. A comprehensive, project-based study of applied business writing. The aim is to develop documents appropriate to audience and purpose that are well argued and conform to standards to business writing. Topics include context, purpose, audience, style, organization, format, results, technologies, and strategies for persuasion in typical workplace messages. In addition to shorter assignments, a substantial formal report that incorporates research and support for conclusions or recommendations is required. Students may receive credit for only one of the following courses: COMM 394/394X, ENGL 394/394X, or WRTG 394/394X.

## Course Introduction
This course is titled Advanced Business Writing.  However, it deals with all kinds of workplace and professional writing—not just the writing produced in business corporations.  The course will help prepare you for the writing you will encounter in the classes for your major at UMGC as well as writing you might encounter in a workplace or community situation.

As you will discover when you take a detailed look at the class resources, there are hundreds of workplace writing situations—many more than the few writing assignments in this course will prepare you for. No individual textbook chapter or writing assignment will be relevant to all students' present and future employment.

The assignments in the class give you practice with decisions about purpose, audience, organization, style, and word choice. These are the kinds of decisions that need to be made when you produce any workplace and professional writing, regardless of the type of document.

## Understanding Labor Based Grading

You may be used to writing courses in which your assignments are graded on how “good” your writing is. This type of grading may even have led you to believe that you are a “good writer” or a “bad writer.” In this course, we take a different approach. We want all students, no matter their starting points, to have a fair opportunity and a supportive environment to develop. To support these goals, grades for this course will be based on your full and timely good-faith completion of the work that is assigned. More details and answers to some questions you might have are provided below.

## How is my grade determined?
 
The grade for this course is determined based on the labor that you do in response to the course assignments and activities. For most assignments, full and timely good-faith completion of the assigned work by the due date  will result in a grade of B. You will have the opportunity to complete specific additional labor to earn a grade of A. Partial completion of ALL the labor for any assignment can result in a grade below B on the assignment. This is a matter to discuss with your professor.
 
As in most courses you will take, the assignments in this course are weighted. Smaller assignments and those earlier in the course count less toward your course grade than larger assignments that come later. The assignment weights can be found elsewhere in the syllabus.
 
## Will I still receive feedback on my work?
 
Yes. Your professor will provide feedback on your work. Your professor may point out parts of the assigned work that you have not fully completed; this feedback is related to your grade. Your professor will also give you feedback on content and quality of your work; this feedback is meant to further your own personal growth and is not related to your grade.
 
## Why is my grade being determined this way?
 
Students come to WRTG 394 with a wide range of educational, language, and writing backgrounds. In any writing course, but especially in an 8-week course, students with different starting points cannot all be expected to arrive at the same point by the end. In addition, it is not possible or desirable to agree on a single end state that all writers should reach. Just as writers and their goals are different, so too are readers and their opinions.
 
WRTG 394 is meant to provide all students space for the growth they seek as writers. Therefore, your work—the action, not the product—within this space determines your grade. Put differently, you earn your grade through your labor in this class.
 
## What if I have extenuating circumstances and cannot complete my work on time?
 
You should contact your professor as soon as possible and preferably before the missed due date. In extenuating circumstances, your professor can grant an extension that will not affect your grade.
 
## What additional labor can I do to earn an A?
 
Because WRTG 394 is an advanced business writing course, you can earn additional credit by
submitting two extra assignments chosen from a list of possibilities. You will find these extra assignment choices in the Assignments area of the WRTG 394 classroom.
 
Late Essays, Assignments, and Discussions
Students are most successful in an 8-week class when they stick to the schedule. However, if you need to submit late essays and/or assignments, the following late policy will be applied:

Late essays and assignments: Unless special arrangements have been made for late submission, essays and assignments submitted after the due date will lose 10% from the grade for each week or partial week that they are late.  

Late discussions: The purpose of the discussions is to interact with your classmates on the course content for a given week. Posting to discussions after the discussion week does not allow you to interact with your classmates. Consequently, discussion posts made after the discussion week will receive a grade of zero.

Given UMGC's timeline for submission of final course grades, no work will be accepted after the last day of class.
